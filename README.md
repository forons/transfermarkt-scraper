# Transfermarkt-Scraper

This project aims at implementing APIs for football enthusiasts and researchers
for the [Transfermarkt Website](https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/).

In addition, in this repo are reported some tools to render, through matplotlib,
the pitch representation and the players positions for a match.

I built and used this utility while following the great 
[course for Football and Sport commentators](https://www.instagram.com/corso.telecronista.sportivo/)
held by [Enrico Zambruno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enrico-zambruno-5026a470/),
the Italian Football commentator for Juventus TV. One of this course mantras for commentators is
to have the football pitch with the position and extra info about the players,
in such a way to have the data immediately available at hand. Thus, I implemented this
utility to automatically generate such data, mixing two of my passion: data science and sports.
