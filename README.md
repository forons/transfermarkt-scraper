# Transfermarkt-Scraper

This project aims at implementing APIs for football enthusiasts and researchers
for the [Transfermarkt Website][https://www.transfermarkt.co.uk/].

In addition, in this repo are reported some tools to render through matplotlib
the pitch representation and the players positions for a match.

I built and used this utility while following the course for Football and Sport commentators
taken by [Enrico Zambruno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enrico-zambruno-5026a470/?originalSubdomain=it),
an Italian Football commentator for Juventus TV. One of this course mantras was
to have with the football pitch with the position and extra info about the players,
in such a way to have the data available at hand. Thus, I implemented this
utility to automatically generate such data, mixing two of my passion: data science and sport.
